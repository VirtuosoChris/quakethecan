Junior-Year Undergrad Group Project in 2009 at UCF.  Made with two other students, Written in C++ on the Irrlicht Engine.

This was a 1vs 1 adaptation of the popular children's game Kick The Can, adopted into a first person shooter format, to demonstrate different AI behaviors.

These included finite state machines / state transitions, basic steering behaviors, navigation graphs with A*, and others.

This repo has been modified very slightly - irrlicht and irrklang libraries added, one way upgrade of the solution to modern visual studio, and some minor build errors fixed.  There is no CMAKE for this but the visual studio project should work.  Even my 15 year old breakpoints were still present.

You should therefore be able to build and run the game by just opening the EngineTest.sln file in the home directory, compiling, and running with f5.
